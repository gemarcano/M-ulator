This folder contains the trained weights and offsets, and sample input vectors for the 3-layer keyword spotting DNN.

Raw data (floating points) are stored in .csv files, and processed data (fixed points, formatted for KWS compiler script) are stored in files with their respective extensions, like *.weight, *.offsets, etc.

To transform raw data into processed data, use ./parse_csv.py; to zero-pad data use ./zero_padding.py.
