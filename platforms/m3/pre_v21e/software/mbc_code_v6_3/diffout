<  *      Added version numbers to the initial beacons
<  *      Updating next_light_meas_time before checking for new_state in sample_light to fix wake up in the past bug in the new passive window shift
<  *      Added XO calibration method
<  *      Record last threshold crossing for sunsets instead of first
<  *      Switch over delay to timer32 for the RADIO_PACKET_DELAY
<  *      Added passive window shift back
<  *      Using XO clock sync read
