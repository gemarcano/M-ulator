1.15t has been forked from 1.15.

Compared to 1.15:

* Unit of some time variables has been changed from 'minute' to 'second'
    - Start Delay
    - Measurement Interval

* XT1 automtacally stops when 'sample_count == 100 x (HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD in C)'
    - Example
        Write 1 in 'High Threshold (C)' in the app, then XT1 stops once it has measured 100 samples.
        Write 50 in 'High Threshold (C)' in the app, then XT1 stops once it has measured 5000 samples.

* It does NOT check temperature excursions.
    - Check/Cross/+/- are NOT displayed during operation.
        NOTE: These segments are displayed during boot-up.
    - HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD(Byte#68) is used to set the max sample count (See above)
    - LOW_TEMP_THRESHOLD(Byte#70) is NOT used.
    - Once started, XT1 displays the 'play' segment only.
        Once the start delay expires, XT1 still displays the 'play' segment only.
        Once it reaches the 'max sample count', XT1 automatically stops,
        and the 'play' sign disappears, so the display becomes 'all white'.

* Once the start delay expires, XT1 stays in active (i.e., not going into sleep)
    until it automatically stops when 'sample_count == 100 x (HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD in C)'

* NFC does not work while the XT1 stays in active.

* E-ink does NOT refresh while XT1 stays in active.

< Some Technical Details >

The unit of variables below has been changed from 'minute' to 'second'

    eeprom_temp_meas_interval
    eeprom_temp_meas_start_delay
        wakeup_interval
        WAKEUP_INTERVAL_IDLE;
        wakeup_interval_sec     // changed every instance of wakeup_interval_sec to wakeup_interval
        disp_min_since_refresh  // nothing to change
        disp_refresh_interval   // done

    EEPROM_ADDR_TEMP_MEAS_INTERVAL    (Byte#72)
    EEPROM_ADDR_TEMP_MEAS_START_DELAY (Byte#74)

It does not check temperature excursions. 
    Therefore, Check/Cross/+/- are NOT displayed during operation.
    These segments are displayed during boot-up.
    EEPROM_ADDR_HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD(Byte#68) is used to set the max sample count.
    EEPROM_ADDR_LOW_TEMP_THRESHOLD(Byte#70) is NOT used.

Automatically stops when 'Sample Count' == 100 x (HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD in C)

Once the start_delay expires, XT1 stays in active until the above condition is met.
NFC does not work while the XT1 stays in active.

Disables e-ink refresh 
    e-ink updates during boot-up
    PLAY segments are updated upon START and (automatic) STOP.
